# Vipps Vipps Merchant Management API v1

ðŸ’¥ DRAFT: This is unfinished work and subject to change. ðŸ’¥

The Vipps Merchant Management API lets partners, banks and large corporations manage their merchants and sale units.

In the initial phase it will only be possible to make simple queries, replacing the manual work done over email, phone and Slack.

It is only possible to "look up" merchants and sale units connected to the partner making the API call:
It is not possible for one partner to retrieve information about a merchant or sale unit connected to a different partner.

**IMPORTANT:** This API specification contains endpoints and methods that have not been implemented, and that are meant as reference for discussions.

API version: 0.0.1.

Document version 0.0.1.
