# Partner API

![Vipps](./images/vipps.png) *Partner API is deprecated and will be phased out in Q4 2023.
Please use the
[Management API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/management-api/).*

All the functionality in the Partner API is available in the Management API for both partners and merchants.
