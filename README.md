# Vipps Partner API PoC

ðŸ’¥ DRAFT! Unfinished work in progress. Useless except for discussions in and with Vipps. ðŸ’¥

----------

**Background:** There are many things that could and should have been improved in the
[Signup API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-signup-api).
Since the Signup API's feature set is rather small, we are looking into a new API (this one)
for both partners, banks and large corporations.

The current list of priorities, which may change at any time, is:
1. All partners should use
   [partner keys](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner#partner-keys).
   Partner keys lets a partner make API calls on behalf of a merchant,
   using the same API keys for all the partner's merchants and sale units.
   There is no need to use separate API keys for each merchant or sale unit, and this eliminates the main reason for using the Signup API: Key exchange.
2. Functionality to retrieve active MSNs for a partner's merchant
   ([`GET:/merchants/{orgno}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-merchant-management-api/#/Merchants/getMerchantDetails))
   and the merchants' active sale units based on MSN
   ([`GET:/merchants/{orgno}/salesunits/{msn}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-merchant-management-api/#/Saleunits/getSaleUnitsByMsn)).
   This will hopefully, with time and extended functionality eliminate most emails, Slack messages and phone calls to Partnerbestilling just to ask for info.

Down the line:
1. Functionality to update a sale unit.
   Changes to a sale unit currently requires BankID login to portal.vipps.no, but a partner should be
   able to make changes to the sale units connected to the partner: Status, name, capture type, skip landing page, etc.
   This will eliminate more emails, Slack messages and phone calls to Partnerbestilling just to aks for a configuration change.
2. Functionality to sign up a new merchant and create a new sale unit.
   This requires BankID login to portal.vipps.no, as there are regulatory requirements that
   complicate making an API for this. Our opinion is that the current signup functionality on
   portal.vipps.no is simple and "good enough" that this functionality can have a lower priority.

**Important:** The properties of `Merchant`, `Sale unit`, `Person` _and other data objects_
will change. They depend on the underlying data model in Vipps.
Think of the current ones as a mix between placeholders and examples.
