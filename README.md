# Partner API

<!-- START_COMMENT -->

The Partner API allows partners to retrieve information about their merchants and their sales units by using their partner keys.

For general information for Vipps MobilePay partners, see
[Partners](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner).

**Important:** The
[Management API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/management-api/),
has replaced the Partner API: All the functionality in the Partner API is available in the Management API.
The upgrade effort will be minimal: The API keys are the same, and the endpoints,
requests and responses are _almost_ identical.
The Management API is for both partners and merchants.
The Partner API will be phased out in Q4 2023.
