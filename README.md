# Partner API

<!-- START_COMMENT -->
ðŸ’¥ Please use the documentation pages here: <https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/partner-api>. ðŸ’¥
<!-- END_COMMENT -->

The Partner API allows partners to retrieve information about their merchants and their sales units by using their partner keys.

For general information for Vipps partners, see
[Vipps Partners](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-partner).

**Please note:** The
[Management API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/management-api/),
currently in development, will replace the Partner API.
The Management API is for both partners and merchants, and will offer all the functionality
in the Partner API plus additional functionality.
The upgrade effort will be minimal, as the endpoints are almost identical.

## Getting started

[Getting Started](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/getting-started)
